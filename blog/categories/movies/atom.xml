<h4>Reason #1: Season / Series Catch-Up</h4>

<p>I have a confession to make. I did not watch <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Breaking_Bad/70143836" title="Breaking Bad">Breaking Bad</a> when it premiered. As someone born and raised in DC and seeing the effects of crime and drugs in the community, I couldn&rsquo;t see how watching a high school chemistry teacher with terminal cancer from Albuquerque, morph into a kingpin meth dealer would be appealing to me. But everyone was talking about it, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. And a one episode experiment turned into a binge.</p>

<p>I also didn&rsquo;t watch <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Walking_Dead/70177057" title="The Walking Dead">The Walking Dead</a>. I like zombies, but not that much. I started watching at the suggestion of friend who said it wasn&rsquo;t just about zombies. And she was right. It&rsquo;s not really about zombies. If there is ever a zombie apocalypse, the zombies are the least of your worries. Watch out for the charismatic man who wears an eyepatch and whistles creepily.</p>

<p>Those are just two examples. Other great series to watch: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/American_Horror_Story/70210884" title="American Horror Story">American Horror Story</a>, <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/30_Rock/70136124" title="30 Rock">30 Rock</a>, <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/It_s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia/70136141" title="It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia">It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a> and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_West_Wing/70157152" title="The West Wing">The West Wing</a>.</p>

<h4>Reason #2: Foreign Movies &amp; Televison</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, American movies are entertaining but they lack originality. You know what&rsquo;s going to happen because it&rsquo;s the same story told over and over again. I find foreign films are much more original and have some of the best acting you&rsquo;ll ever see from people you&rsquo;ve never heard of. It&rsquo;s not surprising Hollywood remakes foreign films and not just the horror flicks (e.g. The Ring, The Grudge).</p>

<p>If you liked the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/" title="The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (US)">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (US)</a> and haven&rsquo;t seen <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Dragon_Tattoo_Trilogy_Extended_Edition/70227034" title="The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy Extended (Swedish)">the original trilogy</a>, you owe it to yourself to watch it. Spike Lee is remaking the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321511/" title="Oldboy">Oldboy</a> starring Josh Brolin (I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this). Watch <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/Movie/Oldboy/70024111" title="Oldeuboi">the Korean version</a> first.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re into CSI, NCIS and Criminal Minds, you&rsquo;ll love British crime/drama. Some of my favorites: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Sherlock/70202589" title="Sherlock">Sherlock</a>, <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Luther/70175633" title="Luther">Luther</a>, <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Masterpiece_Mystery_Wallander/70148125" title="Wallander">Wallander</a>, and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Henning_Mankell_s_Wallander/70157122" title="Wallander">Wallander</a> (original Swedish version).</p>

<h4>Reason #3: Original Progamming</h4>

<p>This is the least compelling reason, but I think it will get better. <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/House_of_Cards/70178217" title="House of Cards (American)">House of Cards</a> with Kevin Spacey (<a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/House_of_Cards_Trilogy_BBC/70200744?trkid=2361637" title="House of Cards (British)">based on the British television show</a>) was an instant hit when it debuted in February becoming Netflix&rsquo;s most streamed show. But not only was the show good, Netflix did something unconventional by releasing the entire season at once. Amazon&rsquo;s Instant Video service has since followed the same model.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Twilight fan (I&rsquo;m not), you may like <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Hemlock_Grove/70242310" title="Hemlock Grove">Hemlock Grove</a> (I didn&rsquo;t). Other Netflix produced shows include: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Orange_Is_the_New_Black/70242311" title="Orange is the New Black">Orange is the New Black</a>, <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Lilyhammer/70221438?trkid=2361637" title="Lilyhammer">Lilyhammer</a> and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Arrested_Development/70140358" title="Arrested Development">Arrested Development</a> (not original but revived).</p>

<p>So there you have it. There are more than enough great shows to watch that will keep you paying the $8/month it costs for a subscription.</p>
